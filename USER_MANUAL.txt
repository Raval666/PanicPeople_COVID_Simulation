Understanding Human Panic Dynamics: This code offers insight into how individuals transition between states of panic and calm based on various factors. By analyzing these transitions, it provides a clearer understanding of the influence each factor holds in inducing panic or maintaining a sense of calm among people.


"This Python script employs Pygame, sys, random, time, and matplotlib.pyplot libraries to simulate human panic dynamics in a graphical interface.

The simulation initializes a window with specified dimensions and creates dots representing individuals. These dots move across the screen, changing color based on interactions and time passage.

Functions are included to detect collisions between dots, draw interactive buttons and sliders, and update the simulation in response to user input and time progression.

To execute the simulation, run the script in a Python environment with required libraries installed. User interaction occurs via buttons for starting, stopping, and stepping through the simulation, while sliders control factors influencing dot behavior.
